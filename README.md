This is my senior project!

This application is meant to be a website where people can create supply and demand advertisements
while others will either rent an item out to them or rent an item from them. Visit the site for more details!

Note: I have not paid for an ssl certificate and your browser might complain about the connection to my server being insecure.

## Backend
The backend is a RESTful framework built using Django and Django-Rest-Framework. I had no experience in this framework
prior to this semester and enjoyed using it. Some of the earlier code needs to be refactored now that I have a better understanding
of the framework.

## Frontend
The frontend is a javascript client created with Angular.js and Bootstrap. I use local storage and cookies to maintain session between
the client and the server. Learning Angular.js in the short time I had was challenging but after some practice I noticed a lot of improvement.
Overall I think programming using Angular.js was my favorite part of this experience!
